Hello! I need you to create a full-stack web application for studying, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. The primary goal is to build a robust, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing tool that helps students organize their tasks, track their progress, and stay focused.

The application should be built with a modern tech stack, initially prepared for deployment on Vercel.

Here are the core technical and feature requirements:

1. Core Technology & Architecture:

Frontend: Please use a modern framework like React (with Vite) or Next.js. Style it using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and customizable design.

Backend & Database: Use Firebase as the backend. Specifically, implement:

Firebase Authentication: For user sign-up and login, exclusively through Google OAuth.

Firestore Database: To store all user data (tasks, study sessions, settings, etc.). The data must be tied to the user's Google account, ensuring seamless synchronization across multiple devices. When a user logs in from any device, their data should be instantly available.

2. Key Features:

A. User-Centric Dashboard:

Upcoming Tasks: A clear, visible section on the main dashboard that shows the most immediate tasks and deadlines.

Daily/Weekly Planner: A comprehensive task list where users can plan their entire week. The app should send reminders for planned activities.

B. Calendar Integration:

Implement a full-screen monthly calendar view.

Users should be able to add, view, and edit deadlines, exams, and important study events directly on the calendar.

Crucially, explore the possibility of connecting to the user's primary Google Calendar to sync events. This would allow them to see their mobile calendar events within the app.

C. Customizable Pomodoro Timer:

A central feature of the app.

Users must be able to adjust the duration of both study sessions (pomodoros) and break times (short and long breaks).

Ambient Sounds: Integrate a list of background sounds to help with concentration during study sessions. Include options like:

Ocean waves

White noise

Birdsong

Rainfall

A quiet library

Aesthetics: The Pomodoro timer interface should be visually engaging. Please use cute, appealing backgrounds (e.g., animated illustrations, cozy scenes, beautiful landscapes). The overall UI should have a "cuqui" (cute/charming) feel.

D. Analytics and Reporting:

A dedicated "Reports" section.

Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports that visualize:

Total hours studied.

Performance metrics (e.g., tasks completed vs. planned).

Concentration patterns (e.g., number of Pomodoro sessions completed).

E. Mood Tracker:

The app should gently prompt the user once a day with a question like, "How are you feeling today?".

Provide simple options for them to log their mood (e.g., using emojis: üòä, üôÇ, üòê, üòï, üòû).

The analytics dashboard should include a chart showing the user's general mood trend over time.

F. Study Schedule & Goals:

A settings area where users can define their ideal study schedule.

They should be able to set target study hours for each day and mark specific days as "off" (e.g., Sunday).

The app should use this schedule to avoid sending notifications on rest days and to help the user track their progress toward their weekly study goals.

Please structure the code logically, with clear components and comments, making it easy to understand and maintain. Thank you!
